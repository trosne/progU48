We feel that this project has given us a good insight into how a larger project with several units should be executed. Even though we only had TDT4140 and didnt't do the entire "fellesprosjekt" we feel that the planning and execution of our part of the project was a good representation of how we immagine a proper development process is executed. Although we feel that overall the execution of the project have been very smooth, there are parts which we realize that we should have done differently. This brings us to the next section.

\section{Things to avoid in future projects}
Overall we feel that the project have been a very smooth process for all of us, and we have all worked well together towards our common goals. Therefore there are not a great deal of things we wish to avoid in future projects, and those that we do wish to avoid are almost exclusively due to missunderstandings. 
For instance one thing we wish to avoid in future projects is missunderstandings concerning meeting times. A typical example is when we make a verbal arangment to start at 10, and some of us are certain that 10 is 10:15 rather than 10 sharp. This is a quite common missunderstanding at NTNU though, and not something that have lead to any problems. 
Another important thing to avoid in future projects is lack of communication. This to ensure that we do not have problems with parts of the implementation not interfacing with eachother due to differences in design.
